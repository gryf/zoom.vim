Control Vim editor font size with keyboard or mouse.

==============================================================================
Remarks.

This plugin is for GUI only.

Currently, this plugin olny works for fonts, that are defined as a typeface 
name AND the size. For example: >

    set guifont=DejaVu\ Sans\ Mono\ 12
    set guifont=Consolas:h10:cEASTEUROPE
    set guifont=Monaco:h11

Putting only name will not work at all, since guessing default font size for 
all of the operating system can be difficult.

For Linux, *BSD or other unix-like system it will be assumed, that graphical 
environment is an X11 system. Wayland, or other non-X solutions will be added 
as they emerged, however wayland-x11 driver may work OOTB.

==============================================================================
